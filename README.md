# Winter react jam :snowflake:

[The challenge](https://youtu.be/gNOrw5UrQ1w) :arrow_right: Create a game that captures the essence of cooperative in react + run sdk in 10 days.

__OKNOOK__ is a collaborative game based on the discovery of similarities between objects held by each player.   
The main objective is to work with a partner to determine whether or not the objects in question are identical.   
You have to be careful, because the answer can sometimes depend on small details :wink:  
The participants have to ask questions, and only one of them can confirm the choice by using __"OK"__ to indicate that the objects are identical :white_check_mark:, or __"NOOK"__ to mean that the objects are different :x:  
Enjoy ‚≠ê
